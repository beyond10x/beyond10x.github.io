# The evidence file

In an `aep.project/5` store, each evidence record about an artifact is one JSON file. This is the
**planning-store** record that `move` counts. The typed records that `aep govern evaluate` reads are
a different format, described under
[evidence records](./documents.md#evidence-records).

## Where

```text
.engineering/evidence/<kind>/<name>/<instant>-<sequence>-<digest>.json
```

| Part | Value |
|---|---|
| `<kind>/<name>` | the artifact's id, split at the colon: `story:pay-by-card` → `story/pay-by-card` |
| `<instant>` | the record's `at`, with every character except letters and digits removed: `20260928T085501Z` |
| `<sequence>` | three digits: how many records of that same second the directory already held, so records made in one second sort in the order they were made (files written before 0.65.0 have no sequence) |
| `<digest>` | the first 12 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the file's own bytes |

Identical copies of one record, which can come from a migrated journal, get `-1`, `-2`, … appended
to the stem, because each copy counts.

## Fields

```json
{
  "at": "2026-09-28T08:55:01Z",
  "actor": "human:alex",
  "artifact": "story:pay-by-card",
  "kind": "story",
  "revision": 4,
  "change": {
    "change": "evidence",
    "kind": "test_result",
    "source": "cargo test -p checkout",
    "reference": "https://ci.example.invalid/runs/1042"
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `at` | when the observation was made: `evidence --at`, or now |
| `actor` | who recorded it, from `AEP_ACTOR` |
| `artifact`, `kind` | what it is about, and that artifact's kind |
| `revision` | the artifact's revision when the record was admitted; `explain` prints it |
| `change.change` | always `evidence` |
| `change.kind` | the evidence kind, one the protocol declares: `test_result`, `approval`, `review_outcome`, … |
| `change.source` | where it came from (`--source`); for a `review_outcome`, the review's id |
| `change.reference` | where to look (`--ref`), when given |
| `change.review`, `change.outcome` | on a `review_outcome` only: the `review-result` id and `fixed`, `escalated` or `no-op` |

The file is pretty-printed JSON with a trailing newline.

## Rules

- **Never rewritten.** Writing the same record again answers the same path and changes nothing. A
  different file at that path is refused.
- **Written atomically.** The file is written under a temporary name in the same directory and then
  linked into place, so a reader never sees half a record.
- **Counted per artifact.** `move` counts the records under the artifact's own directory, per
  `change.kind`, against the rung's `requires:`.
- **Refused kinds.** An evidence kind the protocol does not declare is refused, and the refusal
  lists the kinds that are declared.

## Written by

| Command | Record |
|---|---|
| `aep plan artifact evidence <id> --kind <k> --source <s> [--ref <r>] [--at <instant>]` | one record |
| `aep plan artifact evidence <id> --kind review_outcome --review <review-id> --outcome <o>` | a review outcome |
| `aep plan artifact evidence <id> --from <ess-report> [--suite … \| --suite-input …]` | a record read out of an ESS conformance report |
| `aep plan store migrate git` | one file per journalled evidence record of an `aep.project/1` store |
