# `worktree`

Use this plugin whenever an agent needs an isolated Git checkout, hands work to another session,
or audits old linked worktrees.

| skill | for |
|---|---|
| `worktree:init` | install the `worktree` CLI, activate a workspace, check it |
| `worktree:managing-worktrees` | create, lease, finish, inspect and clean worktrees |
| `worktree:cleanup` | command: `/worktree:cleanup` reviews the managed trees, finishes and garbage-collects only the ids you approve, and reports what it kept and why |
| `worktree:upgrade` | check the plugin and CLI, offer the upgrade |

```text
/plugin install worktree@b10x
```

Codex: `codex plugin add worktree@b10x`. Then `/worktree:init` installs the CLI — the prebuilt,
checksummed archive from the [worktree release](https://github.com/beyond10x/worktree/releases), or with `cargo` on request —
and runs:

```bash
worktree activate --profile <profile.toml> --workspace <workspace-root>
worktree doctor --check
```

The skill teaches agents to create trees outside the primary repository collection, maintain live
session leases, and publish wanted commits before finishing. Cleanup is review-bound: inspect
`worktree gc --repo <primary> --dry-run`, then pass only ids from that review to
`worktree gc --repo <primary> --apply --id <reviewed-id>`. Locked, live, offline, unmanaged, and
out-of-policy trees are retained, and so are dirty and local-only trees unless `worktree archive`
holds their exact current state. Work merged as rebased or cherry-picked copies is recoverable when
an advertised ref carries every unique commit's exact patch.

`/worktree:cleanup [--repo <primary>] [--id <id>…]` starts that review by hand. It is a command:
only you start it, never the model, and it hands off to `worktree:managing-worktrees` for every
step — `inspect`, `archive` for work that must not be published, `finish`, `gc --dry-run --id`,
then `gc --apply --id` for the ids you approved. It never forces a removal.

`worktree inspect --repo <primary>` reports actual Git state, storage, ignored files, leases and
retention blockers. It defaults to one repository; use `--workspace` to inspect the wider profile.
Add `--refresh` for current remote recovery evidence. Inspection does not infer story completion
or authorize removal.

Use `worktree reconcile --repo <primary> --dry-run` for interrupted provisioning, adopted legacy
paths, finished external trees, and already-missing records. Apply only exact reviewed ids.
External retirement additionally requires the explicit `--allow-external-retirement`
acknowledgement. A missing record whose recorded commit is gone for good, including one whose
repository was deleted (`repository-missing`), is retired only with
`--acknowledge-unrecoverable <recorded-commit>`, which the command refuses while any ref still
contains that commit.

The plugin contains no cleanup script and no independent policy copy; `agentplugins-check tools`
checks every command it spells against the newest `worktree` release.
