# Choose by the decision you need to make

Start with the narrowest plugin that covers the task.

## Finding the right surface or creating a plugin

Use **`b10x`** when you are unsure which specialist owns the work, need the public resource map,
or want to create or port a plugin. Its plugin creator makes shared skills the canonical workflow
so the capability works in Codex and Claude Code, while keeping host-specific wrappers explicit.

## Planning or understanding work

Use **`aep`** (its `planning` skill) when the repository has a governed artifact store, or when you need to turn a
goal into reviewable epics, stories, and tasks. Its agents can decompose, review, or reverse-engineer
work, but `aep:planning` remains responsible for legal lifecycle moves.

## Delivering a development story

Use **`aep:implementing`** when an accepted story is ready to scope and implement. Its wave mode
defines coordination and review roles for an interactive session; its drive mode hands one story to
the reference driver instead, where the bounds are decided by the engine rather than followed by
an agent — and it says before it launches that the driven walk has not yet reached `complete`.
Neither makes a draft plan implementation-ready.

## Specifying a system contract

Use **`ess`** (its `specifying` skill) when writing, editing or reviewing an Executable System
Specification, or generating documentation, OpenAPI or a conformance suite from one; `retrofitting`
derives one for a system that already runs, and `testing-conformance` holds an implementation to it.
It reports unsupported semantics instead of inventing them. New to ESS: start with the
[tutorial](tutorials/first-ess-specification.md).

## Managing repository workspaces

Use **`worktree`** before an agent changes a repository or when linked worktrees need an
inventory or cleanup sweep. Every command its skills spell is checked against the newest `worktree`
release, so the documented commands and the executable safety policy stay aligned. The plugin does not delete unmanaged trees
or replace the standalone toolchain.

## Using configured integrations

Use **`connectors`** to set up providers, diagnose readiness, and search, describe, and invoke
admitted operations through the standalone `connectors` CLI. Both hosts load the same skill;
credentials and grants remain owned by the Connector. See [installation](plugins/connectors.md).

Installing more than one is reasonable when the work crosses those boundaries. Their scopes are
complementary. The `b10x` front door routes to them; it does not absorb their instructions.
